# Day 7

Today's code was written in Racket. I just wrote it with the DrRacket editor that came with the Racket installation. After trying to solve it in Common Lisp, but kinda bouncing off of that, because of cryptic-looking error messages, I'm happy to have still solved it with a lisp-descendant.

`day7`.rkt only contains the solution for part 2. To get the solution for part 1, just remove line 14.
