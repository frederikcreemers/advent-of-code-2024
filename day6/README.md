# Day 6

Today's code was written in MATLAB. On my mac, I run it using octave. You can probably run it from the terminal, but I did

```
octave --gui
```

In the current directory, and then ran the file inside the GUI.

My solution is super inefficient. I could probably make it a lot better by passing along the already visited locations when adding a new wall and checking for cycles. But, this one, after running for a while, works correctly, and my brain is mush.
