# Day 10

I solved today's challenge using Dart. It's a C-style language, so that's familiar territory for me. All I had to do was figure out the basics of the syntax for defining functions and their parameter/return types, control flow, and some very basic functions for iterating over collections which are very similar in most languages. It also helped that my first attempt at part 1 ended up being the correct solution for part 2.

Because I use records, Dart 3.x is required to run this solution.

`dart run day10.dart`
