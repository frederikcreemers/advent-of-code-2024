# Day 14

I solved part 1 of this challenge pretty easily with the [Arturo](https://arturo-lang.io) programming language. Quite a neat scripting language, though I think I'll stick with Python for my scripting needs.

I did resort to writing a visualization in HTML and JavaScript for part 2, though, because I got pretty stuck on finding tree-shaped easter egg. You can find the [visualization on Codepen](https://codepen.io/bigblind/pen/RNbZEOG?editors=1112).

To run the code for part 1, run
