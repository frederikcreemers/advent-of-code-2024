# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/). Each folder contains both solutions for a day, along with very basic instructions on how to run them. I'm going to try doing these challenges in as many different programming languages as I can

# No LLMs\*

I'm using these challenges to flex my programming muscles in various languages. Using an LLM to solve the problems would defeat that purpose. \*I did write them with Copilot enabled, but did never prompt it using comments, and would only accept suggestions that acted as a simple outocomplete for functions or language constructs.
