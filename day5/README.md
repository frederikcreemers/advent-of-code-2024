# Day 1

I solved today's challenge in [Gleam](https://gleam.run). A fairly new programming language that runs on the Beam VM, but can also run in the browser. I found it quite challenging, because I'd usually heavily rely on indexing into lists for challenges like this. My functional programming muscle got a real workout.

With Gleam installed, you can cd into this directory, and run

```
gleam run
```
