# Day 13

I wrote today's solution in Java, a language I hadn't touched in about 10 years. It was fun to get to know some of the modern features like records and lambdas, that have been introduced into the language, but I think I'd still prefer to keep programming in other, more modern languages, even if they run on the JVM under the hood.

This one also challenged me mathematically. I was aware that this was basically a case of solving a system of equations, but had to google a lot to recall how to actually do it.

With JDK 21.x installed, you can run

```
java Day13.java
```
