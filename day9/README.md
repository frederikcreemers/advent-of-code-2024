# Day 9

I solved today's challenge using Clojure. Another adventure in the land of s-expressions. I'm still not used to all the brackets, and I have a tendency to want to put them on separate lines, so they look somewhat like the curly-braced blocks I'm familiar with from C-style languages. I could probably get used to putting all my closing brackets on one line, maybe with some helpful editor plugins installed.

You can run today's solution with

```
clojure -M day9.clj
```
